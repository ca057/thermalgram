> Hopefully your next cool fotobox application. Some spaghetti code otherwise.

## Overview

Thermalgrams main part is a thermal printer connected to a Raspberry Pi, which works as a server and receives images to print from the client running the respective web application. The visual interesting part origins from the usage of a thermal printer.

## Status & TODOS

**Client**

- In a messy state while trying to finish it: It's possible to connect to a server, take a picture and send it to the server.

**Server**

- Can receive pictures, convert them to black and white and print them.

**Printer**

- Can print the picture sent by the server, quality is super bad.
